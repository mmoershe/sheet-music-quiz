# sheet-music-quiz

New repository for my old sheet-music-quiz

## Context

I have always been embarrassingly bad at sight-reading sheet music, and I really
wanted to change that. For me personally, the problem was the **thinking** part:
I didn’t want to count lines or consciously recall every note anymore, but
instead build a more **intuitive** feel for it. To train that intuition, I was
looking for a fast-paced quiz that forces quick recognition rather than slow
reasoning. I couldn’t find anything online that did for me, so I decided to
build my own. A big part of sight-reading is recognizing intervals. Often, it's
easier to read a note relative to a different note, assuming you know your
intervals. This is why this quiz consists of two sections: _Intervalle_ and
_Töne_, althought the latter one turned out to be the focus of this project and
is the one that may actually be useful.
